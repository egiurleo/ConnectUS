Hey, everyone! This is the current structure of our hacky backend:

userinfo.txt:
map coordinates, 1 if completed, 0 if not -- the last one can have three values, 0, 1, 2, 0 for not completed, 1 for accepted, 2 for declined
visibility, 1 if visible to everyone, 0 if only visible to friends
friends, user ids of friends (five digit numbers, correspond to text files)
friend requests, user ids of people who have sent friend requests

otherusers.txt:
list of user ids that exist

[five digit numbers].txt -- info about user with that user id
name
country
languages
email
phone
place on map (see explanation below userinfo.txt)
